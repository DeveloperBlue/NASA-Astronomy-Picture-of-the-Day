### This Project
This project is an experiment built to mimick [NASA's Astronomy Pictore of the Day (APOD)](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/) website. My implementation was built using NASA's [APOD API](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#apod). It uses their API to display content in this considerably nicer formatted page.
